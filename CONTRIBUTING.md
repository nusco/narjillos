## Contribute to Narjillos

I don't expect that you will contribute to this project--but if you want to, here are the “instructions”, and feel free to contact me if you have trouble. The overhead of maintaining a Gradle build wasn't worth the effort, so I decided to just use IntelliJ.

(Gradle and Maven are a shaky pile of fragile, bitrotting technology. If I ever return to a build system, it will be either old-fashioned Ant, or Rake with JRuby.)

### Setup the environment

* Fork the [repository](https://github.com/nusco/narjillos/#fork-destination-box)
* Clone the repository to your local environment `git clone [your forked repo]`
* Import it into IntelliJ. Please submit an [issue](https://github.com/nusco/narjillos/issues) if you have trouble doing that.

### Check that everything is in order

* Run the tests in `src/test/java`.
* Run the class `NarjillosRunner.java`

### Start contributing and further information

* Look at the current backlog in `backlog.md`

### Having issues, problems, or suggested improvements?
