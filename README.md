# Narjillos

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nusco/narjillos.svg)

Narjillos are artificial creatures that mutate and evolve in a virtual microscope dish, under the pressure of natural selection. They swim to reach food, but they don't really know what "swimming" means - they just swing their bodies around. Yet, they evolve good swimming behaviors over time.

See the [site](http://nusco.github.io/narjillos/) for more.
