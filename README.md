# Narjillos

Narjillos are artificial creatures that mutate and evolve in a virtual microscope dish, under the pressure of natural selection. They swim to reach food, but they don't really know what "swimming" means - they just swing their bodies around. Yet, they evolve good swimming behaviors over time.
